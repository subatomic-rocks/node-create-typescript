# TypeScript Template for Node

Just a bare-bones template for your NPM-based TS application.
Entry-point is located at `src/main.ts`, which will output to `dist/main.js`

Run `npm start` to automatically build and start the application or `npm run build` to just build it.

## Usage

Just go into your project directory and `npm init @subatomic-rocks/typescript` to create a project using the template.
