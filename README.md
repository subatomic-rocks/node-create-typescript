# TypeScript Template for Node

Just a bare-bones template for your NPM-based TS application.

Entry-point is located at `src/main.ts`, which will output to `dist/main.js`

## Usage

Just go into your project directory and `npm init @subatomic-rocks/typescript` to create a project using the template.

When done, run `npm run watch` to work with hot-reload, `npm start` to run once or `npm run build` to just build your project.
